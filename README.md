Welcome to the AI Kid Simulator repository! This project is an exciting endeavor to build an AI from scratch without relying on existing libraries. The goal is to create a system that mimics the behavior of a human kid, capable of learning and exhibiting expected behaviors.

Project Overview
Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to explore the development of an artificial intelligence system that mirrors the learning process and behaviors of a human child. By building this AI from scratch, we aim to understand and model the cognitive processes involved in early childhood learning.

Features
Learning Capabilities: The AI is designed to learn from interactions and experiences, adapting and evolving its behavior over time.

Behavioral Mimicry: Our AI will mimic the behavior of a human kid, showcasing curiosity, playfulness, and the ability to acquire new skills.

Teaching Mechanism: Users can actively engage in teaching the AI, observing how it comprehends and incorporates new information into its behavioral repertoire.
